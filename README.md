# Numerai tournament repo

This repo is largely based on the work of "johnputmanii" (https://github.com/johnputmanii/numerai_xgb_eb) and Numerai repo (https://github.com/numerai/example-scripts). It's not affilaited or linked in any way with Numerai.

Since the tournament evolves and changes over time the project is divided in folders for any tournament phase.

For example the folder sep_2021 will include files relative to the version of September 2021 of the tournament (1050 features and 20 targets).
